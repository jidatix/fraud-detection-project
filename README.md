# Fraud Detection Project

## Goal
Detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions using classical ML models and Neural Networks.

## Dataset
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023)

## Project Notebook
[Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10cyqdVF7_ZeonYUb2tpzfjJuzR0FT8iG?usp=sharing)

## Models & Results
- **Classical ML:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- **Neural Network:** 3 experiments with different layers, dropout, optimizers, and batch sizes  
- **Best Classical Model:** Random Forest (Accuracy ~100%, F1 ~0.94)  
- **Best NN Experiment:** Experiment 3 (Highest recall, balanced performance)

## Bonus
- Early stopping & dropout layers applied  
- Trained on Google Colab
